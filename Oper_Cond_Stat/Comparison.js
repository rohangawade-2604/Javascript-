let a = 5;

console.log("a == b is ", a == b);  // Output: a == b is false, it checks if a is equal to b
console.log("a == c is", a == c);  // Output: a == c is true, it checks if a is equal to c
console.log("a == d is", a == d);  // Output: a == b is true, it converts the string d to a number and checks if a is equal to d
